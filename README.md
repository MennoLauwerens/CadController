# CadController

In this project I am trying to make a cheap universal controller for CAD programs, to
control rotation, translation, zoom and some ( 4? ) programmable buttons.

It is based on a Arduino Leonardo and will include 3D printed parts

The 3D printed body will be designed in Fusion360

# Partlist (so far)

1x Joystick (http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Dual-axis-XY-Joystick-Module-For-Arduino-ps2-Joystick-Module/32345829014.html)
